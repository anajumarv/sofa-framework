<!--Usage: specify your extra path list in the environmentPath data.
The directory list must be space separated, and can be expressed relatively to the current directory (ie SofaDir/examples/Objects in this case).
 The list will be appended to the Sofa DataRepository, which already contains SofaRootDir/examples and SofaRootDir/share.
   Limitations: the paths will be appended after the whole .scn file has been parsed, so it to be used to process 
   other <include href= /> tags.
   Example :
   <include href="Objects/envPath.xml" environmentPath=" ../../applications/projects/voxelcutting/examples/mesh/ ../../applications/projects/voxelcutting/examples/shaders/"/>
