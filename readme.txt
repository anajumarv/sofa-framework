To build the project Sofa under Windows :

You need to verify the path of QTDIR in project.bat. It must point to the directory Sofa/Tools.
For example, if you have download Sofa on C:\Sofa, the variable QTDIR=C:\Sofa\Tools.

Verify in the sofaVC7.cfg (or sofaVC6.cfg) to have the good configuration to build a project.

 - console :
	Open a console (by cmd) and execute qmake.
	Then, build all project with nmake. 
	
 - MSVC 6 :
	 Launch Project VC 6.bat. 

 - MSVC 7 : (Visual .net)
	 Launch Project VC7.bat.	 
	 
 For all Visual Studio project, we have to redo the project if we want
 to debug or release solution. Before, we have to change the
 variable CONFIGDEBUG in sofaVC7.cfg (or sofaVC6.cfg).

sofa.cfg is generated by the merge of sofaVC7.cfg (or sofaVC6.cfg) and sofaCommon.cfg


After creating the project, verify that project example1 is the activated project.
