To build the project Sofa under Windows :

Verify in the sofa.cfg to have the good configuration to build a project.

 - console :
	Open a console (by cmd) and execute qmake.
	Then, build all project with nmake. 
	
 - MSVC 6 :
	 Launch Project VC 6.bat. 

 - MSVC 7 : (Visual .net)

 For all Visual Studio project, we have to redo the project if we want
 to debug or release solution. Before, we have to change the
 variable CONFIGDEBUG in sofa.cfg.
